# Rademacher Sums

This project is the companion code to the paper <i>Tight lower bounds for anti-concentration of Rademacher sums and Tomaszewskiâ€™s counterpart problem</i> by L. Hollom and J. Portier, and produces many of the bounds used in that paper. The paper itself serves as a complete description of the mathematical footing of the project, and the content here concern only the practical details of the code.

The core of the code is based on the project https://github.com/ohadkel/oleszkiewicz-problem. Here it is translated into Rust and extended to perform significantly more general simulations.

## Using the code
The code should be run as a rust cargo project. There are three functions which can be run:
